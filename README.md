# Scheduling_algorithms
Program in C++ that demonstrates different scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Round Robin (RR).<br>
This program demonstrates the FCFS, SJN, and RR scheduling algorithms using a sample set of processes. The waiting time and average waiting time for each process are calculated and displayed.
